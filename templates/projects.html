<h4>The Exchange Digital Collection--University of Michigan Museum of Art (February 2016-present)</h4><p>The University of Michigan Museum of Art recently received a grant to create the Exchange, a custom-made digital collection interface designed to organize and display learning resources, object files, and user-generated content related to the Museum's collections. Since February of 2016, I have been preparing portfolios for ingest into the Exchange through the creation of metadata and subject tags. I also attend weekly staff meetings in preparation for the implementation of the Exchange.</p>

<h4>Organize it and Link it: Sharing Digital Objects Using Archivist's Toolkit--National Museum of American History (Alternative Spring Break, 2016)</h4><p>The National Museum of American History Archives Center digitizes materials upon request instead of implementing large-scale digitization programs. Rather than create and maintain digital collections, Archives Center staff members embed digital images within online archival access tools. Between February 29 and March 4, 2016, I organized a number of recently-digitized images into hierarchies within the Smithsonian's Digital Asset Management System (DAMS). After situating the digital objects in their respective hierarchies, I linked the images in slideshow format to online finding aids and catalog records. Check out my Seelio portfolio for more information about this project!</p>

<h4>The Library of the Oneida Community Digital Collection--Hamilton College, Department of Special Collections (June 2014-August 2015)</h4><p>Compiled RefWorks records containing information about approximately four thousand 17th-19th century books and serial volumes at the Oneida Community Mansion House. Recorded information about marginalia, bookplates, inserted materials, and other defining characteristics for each item.  Incorporated results into a paper titled "Reading the Way to Perfection: An Analysis of Print Culture in the Oneida Community." Presented paper at the New York Six Undergraduate Research Conference on September 20, 2014.  Participated in the creation of an Islandora digital collection for the Oneida Community Mansion House library by editing records before and after ingest, supplementing records with links to electronic texts, and writing web content.</p>
